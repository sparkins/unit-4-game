Week 4 homework assignment:

Crystals Collector Game

There are four crystals images displayed on the page.
At the start of each game, each crystal will be assigned a random point value.
The player will also be shown a random target number.
The player must click on crystals to accumulate their current score.
The object of the game is to accumulate the exact 'Target Score'.  If you do, you win, if you go over you lose.
The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
The number of games won and lost will also be displayed.
After each win or loss, the game will restart with new Crystal point values and a new target score.
Game design note:
The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120
Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
